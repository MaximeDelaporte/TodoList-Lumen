When Git is installed, go to an empty directory and use git clone 
https://github.com/MaximeDelaporte/TodoList-Lumen/tree/master <name your directory>

When it's done go inside this directory

do "git checkout dev" to switch to the dev branch
Now that you're on 'dev' do "git checkout -b <name of your branch>"
You have now a branch of your own
You can commit your branch using "git add *" "git commit -m '<your commit>'"
"git remote add <your branch> https://github.com/MaximeDelaporte/TodoList-Lumen/" (only for the first time)
"git push origin <your branch>"
